# get started with Tkinter with a hello world, application
# work with widgets such as buttons and text boxes
# control your applications with a geometry managers
# make your applications interactive by associating button clicks with pythons functions
# Tkinter is a well-known library for creating GUI -based applications
# Enable us to create a fully featured application with the help of widgets, functions and modules
# The frame widget in Tkinter manages all widgets in an application as a container
# Geometry manager helps to create  the layout of the widget and place them in a certain order
# The foundational element of the Tkinter GUI is window 
# Window is the container in which all other GUI elements are going to be placed. These other GUI elements such as text boxes,
# labels and buttons are known as widget
# mainloop() tells the python to run Tkinter event loop. This method listens for events such as button clicks and blocks any code that comes after it
# from running it until you close the window where you call the method

# Widgets are those which user interact with the programs
# Each widget in Tkinter is defined by a class
# Label widget -> used to display text on the screen
# Button -> that can contain texts and perform actions when clicked
# Entry -> widget that allows only a single line of text
# Text -> allows multiline text entry
# Frame Widget -> rectangular region

# Each window or frame can use only one Geometry manager
# BUt different frames can use different GEometry managers

# .pack() uses a packing algorithm to place widgets in a Frame or Window in a specified order, ceneters
